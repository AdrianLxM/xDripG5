A iOS framework providing an interface for communicating with the G5 glucose transmitter over Bluetooth. The name and inspiration comes from [xDrip](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/), a breakthrough application for connecting to the G4 system.

*Please note this project is neither created nor backed by Dexcom, Inc. This software is not intended for use in therapy.*

## Usage

The quickest way to run the example project is via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Run `pod try xDripG5` in the terminal. 
Since Bluetooth LE is required, you will need to build and run on a real device.

If you plan to run your app alongside the G5 Mobile application, make sure to set `passiveModeEnabled` to true.
